# Week 1 DevOps Homework: Deploy and Containerize a Node.js App

Welcome to your first DevOps hands-on project! 🚀

In this assignment, you will set up your first AWS server, deploy a basic Node.js web server, containerize it using Docker, and manage your code using Git and GitHub.

This exercise will solidify your understanding of AWS EC2, Linux basics, web servers, containerization, and version control — foundational skills for any DevOps Engineer!

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Launch an EC2 instance on AWS.
- Deploy a custom Node.js (Express.js) web server.
- Containerize the application using Docker.
- Push all code to a GitHub repository.
- Practice troubleshooting common DevOps setup issues.

---

## 🛠️ Tasks to Complete

1. **Provision an AWS EC2 Instance**  
   - Use Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Free Tier t2.micro)
   - Open ports 22 (SSH) and 3000 (Node app) in the Security Group.

2. **Install Node.js and Create a Simple Web Server**
   - Install Node.js and npm.
   - Create a small Express.js app returning a basic web page.

3. **Test Your Node.js App**
   - Access your server via `http://<your-ec2-ip>:3000`

4. **Containerize Your App**
   - Write a Dockerfile.
   - Build and run the app inside a Docker container.

5. **Push Your Work to GitHub**
   - Upload `server.js`, `Dockerfile`, `package.json`, and optionally a `README.md`.

## 🖥️ Expected Deliverables

- GitHub repository link containing:
  - `server.js`
  - `package.json`
  - `Dockerfile`
  - (Optional) `README.md`
- Live app accessible at: `http://<your-ec2-public-ip>:3000`
- Screenshot of app running (optional but encouraged).
